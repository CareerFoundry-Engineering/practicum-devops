### Rules

- Clone this repo and create your branch for implementing the solution and upon completion, push the Branch to remote.
- Complete the challenge within five days, mention time spent in hours explicitly taken for solving the challenge
- Your solution should be clean, readable, maintainable, and implemented with an emphasis on DevOps methodologies.
- You are free to use the programming language, tools, and cloud platform of your choice.
- Provide a description, execution steps, and testing steps in a plain text file (EXECUTION-STEPS.md)
- We are not looking for completion or perfection, we expect trade-offs to happen.
- Submit all the codebase, diagrams, and documents
- Bonus points: For the solutions built with a best security practice
### Prerequisites
* You need a GitHub account to push your branch (submit your solution) to remote.
* You might need an AWS/Azure/GCP account. Create one if you do not own one already. You can use free-tier resources for this test.

### Challenge

Your fellows of the platform team, backend engineer, and frontend engineer are working separately on a RoR API(with a PostgreSQL DB), frontend(using react) and they have created a collaborative monorepo.

- Create the infrastructure for this project using IaC
    - remember: You are free to use the programming language, tools, and cloud platform of your choice.

### Expect to be asked these questions in the technical fit.
- What would you, as the sole member of the DevOps team, do to best support this team now?
- How would your priorities change as this project matures over time?
- What about when it starts being used by end-users?
- What if the DevOps team grew to have three total members?
